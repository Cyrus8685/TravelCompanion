# TravelCompanion 
Your guide to exploring new places!


## Description

This app is designed to allows the user to easily search for hotels or restaurants in a location that they input via the main page. The user will open the app to a registration screen that requires them to sign on in order to proceed. After registering they are brought to the main page where they can search for a location, then choose whether they'd like to search for restaurants or hotels. Once they choose the category they'd like to use, they will then be brought to the corresponding page where a map will be shown with markers for either hotels or food can be seen, as well as a list of names for each location.

## Usage

In order to utilize the app the user must go through registration. Once registered they will be able to access the entirety of the app and will be brought to the home page. At the home page the user simply has to search a location, click on an autocomplete option, then press the search button and pick a category for what they'd like to look for in the area.
